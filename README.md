# QuickReview for GitHub

> Reviewing 50+ Pull Requests a day is no fun. Automate it with keyboard shortcuts

I thought this is a cool idea and will boost my productivity as I review dozens of PRs everyday.

ðŸ¤” Problem: too much time spent fiddling with a cursor to hide viewed files, approve or merge PRs.

ðŸ’¡ Solution: Automate manual clicks with keyboard shortcuts.
